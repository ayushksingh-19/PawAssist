## Project Overview

PawAssist is a modern pet care platform built with resilience at its core. Pet owners can manage health records, book grooming or veterinary services, request emergency ambulances, view rewards, and access a polished dashboard from a single application.

One of the key ideas in PawAssist is graceful fallback behavior:

- The frontend tries the live backend first
- If the backend is offline, the frontend falls back to local demo data
- If MongoDB is unavailable, the backend falls back to an in-memory store

This keeps the app usable in both real and demo/development environments.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| React 19 | UI framework |
| Vite | Build tool and dev server |
| React Router DOM | Client-side routing |
| Zustand | Global state management |
| Axios | API client |
| React Icons | Icons |
| Plain CSS | Styling |

### Backend

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Node.js | Runtime |
| Express 5 | API server |
| Mongoose | MongoDB ODM |
| MongoDB | Primary database |

## Architecture

PawAssist uses a layered resilience approach:

1. Frontend calls the backend API when available.
2. If the backend is unreachable, frontend services return fallback demo data.
3. Backend connects to MongoDB when configured and reachable.
4. If MongoDB fails or is not configured, backend uses an in-memory store.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- MongoDB optional
- npm

### Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```

Backend default:

- `http://localhost:5001`

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend default:

- `http://localhost:5173`

### Run Both on Windows

From the project root:

```bat
start-pawassist.bat
```

This opens two terminals:

- frontend on `http://localhost:5173`
- backend on `http://localhost:5001`

## Environment Variables

The server includes this example configuration:

```env
PORT=5001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/pawassist
MONGODB_DB=pawassist
```

If `MONGODB_URI` is missing or MongoDB is unavailable, the server automatically uses the in-memory fallback store.
